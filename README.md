# Chromatic Arsenal for NeoForge

Looking for older versions? See [here](https://github.com/NyanMC/ChromaticArsenal).

This is a Chromatic Arsenal rewrite for 1.21.1. Due to several circumstances colliding (1.21 breaking changes, NeoForge breaking changes, Curios just outright no longer existing) that would make porting the mod as-is extremely difficult, I decided to do a full rewrite.

This port is not yet complete, however it is extremely close.



Due to the rather unplayable nature of this mod in its current state, it does not have a public release yet. You are, however, welcome to build the mod yourself if you know how.
