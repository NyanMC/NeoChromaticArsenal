# Chromatic Arsenal for NeoForge

Looking for older versions? See [here](https://github.com/NyanMC/ChromaticArsenal).

This is a Chromatic Arsenal rewrite for 1.21.1. Due to several circumstances colliding (1.21 breaking changes, NeoForge breaking changes, Curios just outright no longer existing) that would make porting the mod as-is extremely difficult, I decided to do a full rewrite.

This port is not yet complete. The main set of accessories (and most of the super accessories) have been ported and should be mostly functional, however none of them can be obtained in vanilla survival. There are also several accessories still missing, which is at the top of my priority list.



Due to the rather unplayable nature of this mod in its current state, it does not have a public release yet. You are, however, welcome to build the mod yourself if you know how.
